This project aims to examine the current interruptability of SM's.
This small text document discusses my findings.

1. SM's are currently interruptible. A memory violation is registered when they
get interrupted and the main loop is run again from the start.
--> Availability is not guaranteed

2. A violation is not registered when SM's are calling unprotected subroutines:
for example if a SM is constantly printing something using printf, an interrupt
during printf will not register a violation
--> Uninterruptible SM's should not call ANY untrusted code or a solution for this
needs to be found.
